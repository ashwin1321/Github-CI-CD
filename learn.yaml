# YAML is similar to JSON.
# but information stored in key value pair
# yaml can have comments unlike json

# test1: scripts1
# test12: scripts2

#  JSON equivalent to above code will be
# {
#   test1: "scripts1",
#   test2: "scripts2"
# }

#nested object
# myapp:
#   service: my-projects
#   test1: scripts1

# lists in YAML
# myapp:
#   service: "my-projects"
#   test1: scripts1
#   myArray: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#   myArray1:
#     - key2: value2
#       keyRandom2: valueRandom2
#     - key1: value1
#       keyRandom1: valueRandom1
# YAML validator

# MULTILINE STRINGS
myapp:
  service: | # use | to indicate that there are multiple lines of strings
    my-project
     this is a simple project
  key1: value1
